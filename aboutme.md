My name is Alain Raymond. I'm currently a PhD student at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, advised by [Álvaro Soto](https://asoto.ing.puc.cl/). My current interests lie in understanding how we can induce Core Knowledge Systems (Spelke, 2007) into current Deep Learning models. In particular, I am focusing my efforts in introducing the Objectness bias into models. This will allow models to "understand" when they are dealing with objects and their properties.

I'm also interested generally in inductive biases as a whole, so if you have a good article/idea on why some models are able to extrapolate I'll be glad to listen to it!

### My story
I got my undergrad in Engineering (Majored in Computer Science) at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. I worked at LATAM Airlines and at the Office of the Presidency (Segpres) before returning for my PhD. I love travelling, roleplaying games and history.
